This repo will contain the scripts and programs I use to work with Fermi Data


Update: Since my last push, I have begun to use Fermi Tools, which can be found here:

http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/

I am working toward replicating and extending certain analysis described in 

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2908.pdf

I apologize for a lack of useful tools made as of late. Most of my coding has been in the form of bash scripts lately. 

If anyone is interested however, I will absolutely include them! Just email me!
